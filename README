Synopsis
--------
A PHP library for generating sitemaps and controlling all the robots.

Features
--------
- Sitemap XML with full schema definitions
- Generate sitemaps and siteindexes
- Support for images in sitemaps
- Enforces sitemap size constraints
- All directives from Robots Exclusion Standard 1.0
- All directives from Robots Exclusion Standard 2.0
- Additional support for unofficial 'Sitemap' and 'Crawl-Delay' extensions

Usage
-----
Generating content suited for a XML sitemap:
```
<?php

use indexed\Sitemap;

// All URLs a relative to the base given here.
$sitemap = new Sitemap('http://example.org');

$sitemap->page('/', array(
    'changes' => 'daily',
    'priority' => '1.0'
));

// Just the URL parameter is actually required.
$sitemap->page('/post/know-the-cat');

// Images are also supported and can be added to existing pages.
$sitemap->image('/img/kittykat.png', '/post/know-the-cat', array(
    'title' => 'My favorite Cat',
    'location' => 'Hamburg, Germany'
));

$xml = $sitemap->generate('xml');

// Now you can echo or save the contents of $xml.

?>
```

Control all the lovely robots:
```
<?php

use indexed\RobotsTxt;

$robotsTxt = new RobotsTxt();

// The following directives apply to all agents.
$robotsTxt->disallow('/admin');
$robotsTxt->requestRate(20);
$robotsTxt->sitemap('http://example.org/sitemap.xml');

// Disallow crawling of the entire site just for Google's AdsBot.
$robotsTxt->disallow('/', 'AdsBot-Google');

$txt = $robotsTxt->generate();

// Now you can echo or save the contents of $txt.

?>
```

Versions & Requirements
-----------------------
Indexed follows the rolling release development model. Code in the master
branch should always considered to be stable. While code in the dev branch
should be considered unstable or sometimes even expiremental.

There are no versions as in the standard release development model but
snapshots. The master branch may be tagged ("snapshotted") at any point in
time when a significant point of development has been reached.

Snapshots are schemed as follows:
[current year, two digit].[index, zero based]

PHP >=5.3.0 is required to run the code.

Installation
------------
Clone the repository or extract a downloaded archive, then move
or copy the resulting directory into /path/to/your/libraries/.

Bootstrap the library by including the `bootstrap.php` file. This will execute
all necessary steps (i.e. register an autoloader), so you can start using the
classes. If you like to have more control over what is configured how, consider
the documented bootstrap file as blueprint for your own setup code.
<?php
// ...

require '/path/to/library/bootstrap.php';

// ...
?>
